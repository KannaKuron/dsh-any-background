/**
 * Assembly of the plugin's one static stylesheet.
 *
 * Until now the sheet was a single template literal in the client entry with
 * thirteen constants bolted together in whatever order they were added. That
 * order is load-bearing and was documented in three separate comment blocks in
 * `wallpaper.ts` — so it is encoded here instead, in one list, with the reason
 * next to each entry.
 *
 * What the release can change lives in the slots marked below: the panel group
 * (which element carries the frost), the plugin-manager page (whether this release
 * ships that page at all), and the menu groups (which token a menu's fill comes
 * from and whose job its frost is). Everything outside a slot is host-agnostic by
 * construction — it targets attributes every release in range emits.
 *
 * The sheet is rebuilt when the release verdict lands. It has to be: `apply` runs
 * synchronously while the verdict is a Node round-trip, so the FIRST sheet is
 * always the unresolved, DOM-arbitrated one. That is the correct interim state,
 * and swapping in the resolved arm a moment later is what removes the `:has()`
 * dependency from hosts we do know the answer for.
 *
 * @module

 * The order contract. Later entries override earlier ones at equal specificity,
 * which several groups rely on:
 *   · headerPopoverRule() after popoverBlurRule() — a surface moving from the card
 *     group to the header group must win, not merely be listed twice.
 *   · PRODUCED_RULE / STROKE_RULE after the blur groups — they shield their
 *     surfaces from an inherited slider.
 *   · exemptDefaultRule() last of the token groups — an exemption has to land
 *     after whatever it exempts.
 *   · PLACEHOLDER_RULE genuinely last — `::placeholder` resets must survive every
 *     group above.
 *
 * Three of these are FUNCTIONS, not constants, and they are version slots like
 * `panel.blur`: which declaration frosts a menu, and which token a menu's fill
 * comes from, is the current adapter's answer (`adapter.menus`). They stay in
 * place rather than moving next to the other slots because the contract above is
 * about position — a slot is only safe if it does not have to relocate.
