/**
 * Selector + declaration vocabulary shared by every per-version adapter.
 *
 * These are the ANCHORS, not the decisions. What varies between releases (which
 * element slides, whether the panel needs promoting, which header slot keys
 * exist) is answered in the version folders; what is stable across all of them
 * lives here so no adapter has to re-type a host selector and get it subtly wrong.
 *
 * Verified against the harness release tags (dsh-v0.1.5-rc.2 … dsh-v0.2.1-alpha.1),
 * not inferred:
 *   · `[data-sidebar-right-panel]` — emitted by `ui-sidebar-right/shell/SidebarRight.tsx`
 *     on every release in range, with values `push` | `fullscreen`.
 *   · `[data-dockkit-host]` / `[data-dockkit-empty]` — emitted ONLY by
 *     `ui-dockkit/components/TabLayout.tsx`, a file that first appears at
 *     0.1.7-alpha.1. Dockkit itself EXISTS earlier (its `TabMenu` carries
 *     `[data-dockkit-tab-menu]` on every release), so only these two attributes
 *     are the 0.1.7 marker — never test "is dockkit installed".
 *   · `[data-dsh-bottom-panel]` — the optional dsh-better-sidebar workbench, not
 *     a host element at all. It is a single element on every release, which is
 *     why it needs no version arm.
 *   · `[data-plugin-panel]` / `[data-plugin-scope] > ul` — emitted by
 *     `ui-plugin-manager/src/client/PluginManagerPage.tsx`. That package is NEW AT
 *     0.1.6-alpha.2: `git ls-tree` shows it absent from 0.1.5-rc.2, 0.1.5-rc.3 and
 *     0.1.6-alpha.1, where the plugin list lived in `ui-settings-plugin-inventory`
 *     under `[data-plugin-scope]` alone — no `[data-plugin-panel]`, and no card
 *     `ul` in that group either. The three anchors this rule matches — `section
 *     [data-plugin-panel]`, `section[data-plugin-scope] > ul.cards` and
 *     `section[data-plugin-loading] > ul.cards` — are re-emitted unchanged at
 *     `0.2.0-rc.2` and `0.2.1-alpha.1` (checked per tag in `PluginManagerPage.tsx`),
 *     so the ONE rule below serves every tag that emits the page.

/**
 * The plugin-manager page's frosted card block, for the releases that ship it.
 *
 * `设置 → 插件` lists each group's plugins in a `ul` that has NO surface of its
 * own — measured live on 0.1.7-alpha.1: a transparent flex column, 2px gaps, each
 * `li` transparent with a 12px radius. With the settings surfaces faded, the whole
 * table floats straight on the wallpaper. This frames each group's list the way the
 * composer capsule is framed: a rounded block on an `::before` underlay.
 *
 * Which releases emit the page decides who gets this string — see `pluginPageRule`
 * in each version folder.
 *
 * The card `ul` is matched through TWO scopes. `0.2.0-rc.1` added a first-read
 * `ListSkeleton` that reuses `.cards` under `section[data-plugin-loading]`, so a
 * rule keyed on `[data-plugin-scope]` alone would show the real list frosted and
 * the loading list bare, then re-frost the block when the data lands. Hosts before
 * that never emit the attribute, so the extra selector is inert rather than a
 * version branch.
 *
 * BINDING, and why it is not just "put it in the dialog": the block paints from
 * `--dsh-any-bg-settings-surface` and frosts from `--dsh-any-blur-settings`, i.e.
 * the settings-opacity / settings-blur pair. On 0.1.7 the page is a child of
 * `centerCol`, NOT of the settings dialog (and from `0.1.7-rc.2` the dialog is a
 * `createPortal` beside `#root`, so it is further away still), therefore
 * `SETTINGS_STYLE_RULE`'s token
 * re-scope never reaches it and the list would otherwise follow the homepage card
 * alpha; reading the plugin-owned variables off `:root` puts them under the slider
 * that owns this page. The `var(--dsw-alias-bg-layer-2)` fallback covers the window
 * before the first `applySettingsOverrides` write.
 *
 * The frost rides an underlay because backdrop-filter must never sit directly on a
 * host part (containing block + backdrop root), and the `isolation` is what keeps
 * the underlay's `z-index:-1` inside the block instead of escaping behind the frame.
 * The `:has([role="dialog"])` valve matters here more than anywhere else: every row
 * carries a `plugins.item` slot that third-party plugins fill with their own
 * controls, so a dialog can legitimately open inside the list.

 * ── Where a menu's paint lives ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Verified by reading the emitting source at each tag, not inferred from a changelog.
 *
 * `dsh-v0.1.5-rc.2` … `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.1`: the menu ELEMENT paints itself. Its own
 *   CSS module declares `background:var(--dsw-specific-menu)` — 11 files at
 *   0.1.5-rc.2/rc.3 and 0.1.6-alpha.1/alpha.2, 15 at 0.1.7-alpha.1/alpha.2, 16 at
 *   rc.1 (`Menu`, `MenuView`, `PopupSelectView`, `ModelSelect`, `dockkit` TabMenu,
 *   `stat-dialog`, `QueueDock`, `ContextMeter`, `TodoPanel`, `GoalBar`,
 *   `JobListAction`, `HoverCard`, `ScheduleCatalogAction`, `SubagentHeaderLineage`,
 *   `TeamAction`, `CordisPanel`). One token therefore paints every menu, and
 *   filtering the element is the arm that reaches it.
 *   Frost is a separate, later fact, and worth recording because it changes what
 *   the plugin is doing on the older tags: `--dsw-menu-backdrop-filter` has ZERO
 *   consumers before `0.1.7-alpha.1` (15 there, 16 at rc.1). On `0.1.5`/`0.1.6` the
 *   host frosts no menu at all, so the card/header blur sliders are the only reason
 *   a menu has a frost there — which is why the declaration goes on the element
 *   rather than into a host token the host does not read.
 *
 * `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.2` (npm `latest`) and `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.1`: `TabMenu`, `MenuView`,
 *   `PopupSelectView`, `ModelSelect` and `Menu` all render through the new
 *   `ui-primitives/src/MenuSurface.tsx` (byte-identical between the two tags),
 *   which leaves the element unpainted and draws on a `z-index:-1` child instead
 *   (`MenuSurface.module.css` `.material`: `background:var(--dsw-menu-surface-fill)`
 *   + `backdrop-filter:var(--dsw-menu-backdrop-filter)`). The four menu stylesheets
 *   that used to paint the old token (Menu/MenuView/PopupSelectView/dockkit TabMenu)
 *   drop it at rc.2, which is why the painter count goes 16 → 14.
 *   Two consequences, both measured from those files:
 *     · the host FLIPPED ITS ALIAS — `design-platform.css` now declares
 *       `--dsw-specific-menu:var(--dsw-menu-surface-fill)` where every earlier
 *       release declared the reverse. So a plugin that retints only the old token
 *       writes a value nothing on a menu any longer reads, and the card / header
 *       opacity sliders go inert on exactly the surfaces they were built for.
 *     · that child layer exists on purpose: its comment says filtering only the
 *       background "keeps nested menus and fixed overlays free of an ancestor
 *       backdrop root", and the surface sets `isolation:isolate`. Filtering the
 *       element anyway installs the backdrop root the layer was written to avoid.
 *   The frost therefore rides `--dsw-menu-backdrop-filter`, whose consumer set is
 *   the same 14 stylesheets at both tags (stat dialog, queue dock, context meter,
 *   todo panel, goal bar, job list, `HoverCard`, `PickerPopover`/`TaskMenu`/
 *   `ScheduleCatalogAction`, the subagent lineage, `TeamAction`, `CordisPanel`,
 *   `MenuSurface` itself) — re-declaring the token reaches the frost whoever ends up
 *   applying it, and does not depend on any element being the painting element.
 *
 * `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2` (npm `latest`) and `dsh-v0.2.1-alpha.1`: the layer and the frost
 *   are the same files — `MenuSurface.tsx` and `MenuSurface.module.css` are
 *   byte-identical to rc.1, and every `--dsw-menu-backdrop-filter` consumer is too —
 *   but the sticky GROUP HEADING inside those menus changed owner. Through rc.1 the
 *   only grouped menu was `ModelSelect`, whose own stylesheet painted that heading
 *   from the menu token (`ModelSelect.module.css` `.groupTitle{position:sticky;
 *   background:var(--dsw-specific-menu)}`), so the card slider drove it and a picked
 *   wallpaper color tinted it. At rc.2 the rule is deleted and both grouped popups
 *   (`ModelSelect`, `PopupSelectView`) render the new `ui-primitives/MenuGroup.tsx`,
 *   whose heading stays transparent until `data-stuck` and then paints
 *   `--dsw-alias-menu-group-header-fill` (light `rgba(248,249,250,.94)`, dark
 *   `rgba(48,49,54,.94)`, declared in the `body` blocks of `design-platform.css`).
 *   The surface did not go away — its token was RENAMED, and `ModelSelect.module.css`
 *   is the one `--dsw-specific-menu` consumer that disappears at rc.2. Left alone, it
 *   is the single menu element the fade no longer reaches: an untinted, near-opaque
 *   band sitting on top of every row in the list the moment that list scrolls.

 *  ("the card slider owns every layer of a menu, in the picked color") instead of
 *  leaving an untinted stock band inside a tinted, faded card.
