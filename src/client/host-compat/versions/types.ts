/**
 * The contract every per-version adapter folder implements.
 *
 * Business code reads THESE, never a release string. That is the isolation rule:
 * `0.1.5-rc` / `0.1.6-alpha` / `0.1.7-alpha` / `0.1.7-rc` / `0.2.0-rc` may appear
 * inside `versions/` and in the front-door detector, and nowhere else in the
 * plugin. Adding a new DSH line
 * then means adding one folder and one registry row — no `if` scattered through
 * the styling code.
 *
 * Tri-state fields (`null`) are not optionality, they are an answer: "the release
 * could not be resolved, so do not assert either way". The consumer then falls
 * back to a DOM-shape probe, which is how this plugin worked before any release
 * detection existed — and why an unresolved host still renders correctly.
